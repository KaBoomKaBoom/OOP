# OOP
Labs at oop at uni

**Laboratory nr.1**

The OOP class teacher and the High Council of TUM requested a simple Student Management
system from you! The one they were using is experiencing a major blackout! You have to quickly hack a temporary
solution. OOP teacher knew his students are up for the task, and he quickly scribbled some classes
directed by the heads of the Software Engineering faculty. Using just these scribbles you have to design your version of the system.

**Remarks about working with files in this laboratory:**
- All .txt and .json files used by program are saved into .\Lab1OOP\bin\Debug\net7.0\
